## Tech I Used

## Want to Run It Locally?

1. Clone it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bniladridas/ml-learning-platform.git
cd ml-learning-platform
```

2. Install stuff:
```bash
npm install   # or yarn if you're fancy
```

3. Create a `.env` file and add:
```env
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:5173
VITE_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here  # Get one from Google Cloud Console
```

4. Fire it up:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Now hit up `localhost:5173` and you're golden! 🚀

## Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start coding!
npm run build    # Make it production-ready
npm run lint     # Keep the code clean
npm run preview  # Test the production build
```

## Project Structure

Nothing fancy, just keeping it organized:

```
src/
  ├── components/    # UI stuff lives here
  ├── lib/          # AI magic happens here
  └── index.css     # Global styles
```

## Deployment

I'm using Vercel because it's awesome. Just push to main and it auto-deploys! 🔥
